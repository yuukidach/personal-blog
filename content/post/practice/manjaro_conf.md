Manjaro edition: Manjaro-i3

This post is about how I configure my Manjaro i3

## Softwares to Install

1. fcitx5 (no need to install sogou pinyin for linux anymore)
2. deepin-wine-wechat
3. deepin-wine-tim
4. wps-office (together with `ttf-wps-fonts`)
5. ttf-menlo-powerline-git (font for terminal)
6. mpv (vedio player)
7. netease-cloud-music
8. Insync (sync a certain folder with google driver)

## Multiple Monitors

When we plug a HDMI/VGA cable into the computer, Manjaro i3 will not automatically display content in the external monitor. We need to use `xrandr` to set the display mode.

More specific usage can be found here: [Multiple monitors](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#multi_monitor).
